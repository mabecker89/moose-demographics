# Moose Population and Demographics Analysis Using ABMI Camera Data

### Scripts so far (in `src` folder):

+ 01_clean-compare-raw.R

  Clean the raw tag data from two sources (old csvs and updated directly from WildTrax), and compare results to evaluate how many tags Mateen changed.
  
+ 02_calculate-density.R

  Calculate density of various moose demographic categories using the time in front of camera method.
  
### To-dos

+ Calculate EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Inventory) metrics for each ABMI site

+ Look for evidence of calf birth pulses - May/June? Create plots of events over time.

+ Calculate ratios using camera data at the WMU scale.

+ Create map of sites for visual inspection.
